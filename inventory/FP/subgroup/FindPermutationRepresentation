Objects highlighted:	subgroup H

Other objects present:	group G

Name in the menu:	Find a permutation representation of G on 
                        the cosets of H in G

Problem type:		problem object

Help file:		PermutationRepProblem.help  

//@db We use the same help file for a group too. Do we want that ?


			     Algorithms:


1. Enumerate cosets H		//@db need to fix wording
