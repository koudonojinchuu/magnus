Check-in type:		finitely presented group

Objects highlighted:	group G 

Name in the menu:	Is G abelian ?

Problem type:		problem object

Help file:		IsAbelianProblem.help


			     Fast checks:


1. If (the number of generators - the number of relators) > 1, i.e.
   the group contains non-abelian free subgroup 
    	return no;	


			     Algorithms:


1. For the use of this problem
    
2. Compute lower central quotients for G

3. Solve using lower central quotients of G
 
4. Enumerate normal closure of relators

5. Seek a rewriting system for G
  
6. Seek a ShortLex automatic structure for G
