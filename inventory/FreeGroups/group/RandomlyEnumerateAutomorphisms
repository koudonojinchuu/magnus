Check-in type:		free group

Objects highlighted:	group F

Name in the menu:	Randomly enumerate automorphisms of F

Problem type:		problem object

Help file:		AutEnumerator.help


			Fast Checks:

			
1. If G = < >
	return the group has only one automorphism: 1->1.

2. If G = < x > 
	return  has only two automorphisms: x -> x and x -> x^-1.

3. If the group is abelian and is not free 
	return can't be built automorphism
	// @dp This check works for free groups too.
