 INSTALLING MAGNUS
 =================

 This is the Magnus install guide as of 08/06/2005:

 See README file for what you can do or visit our web site:
         
         http://www.grouptheory.org

 or
	 http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/magnus
         
 for more information.

 PREREQUISITES
 -------------

 In order to compile MAGNUS:
     - gcc distributions with Fedora Core 1, 2, or 3 and FreeBSD 4.11 (with 
       gcc 3.3+), have been successfully tested. A previous version working
       with gcc 2.95.3 is also available. 
	
       Note that MAGNUS running on Fedora Core 3 is problematic,
       though it can be built on it.

     - Tcl/Tk 8.x (see http://tcl.sourceforge.net/). 
       Please do consider upgrading to at least Tcl/Tk 8.3.3.

     - GNU make 3.71 or higher. Earlier/other version of make MAY NOT WORK.
  
     - 64 MB of swap space and 150 MB of disk space for compilation
       of magnus


 INSTALLATION STEPS
 -------------------

 To compile  MAGNUS:

   1) Let magnus_xx_xx_xx  be the MAGNUS' archive name.

      Unpack MAGNUS archive:
          $ tar xvfz magnus_xx_xx_xx.tgz 
      It should create a directory with the source code. Below $magnus will
      refer to this directory.

   2) Run $magnus/Configure script. The script will ask for
      verification that the current directory is correct, and then ask for 
      the path to the tcl executable "wish". (You should verify the path of 
      your wish executable by typing the command, "which wish", and then 
      answer with the path that the "which wish" command gave you.) 

   3) Change to the $magnus directory. Type:
         $ make 
      To compile the package. This can take about 20 minutes on a Pentium III
       machine.
      There is nothing to worry about when make complains of missing
      .d files; it generates them itself.

   4) To invoke magnus type:
         $ $magnus/front_end/magnus.

   5) If you want to save space run 
         $ $magnus/make realclean
      If you want to keep source files do 
         $ $magnus/make mostlyclean

 If you installing precompiled version:

    1) Let magnus_xx_xx_xx  be the MAGNUS' archive name.

      Unpack MAGNUS archive:
          $ tar xvfz magnus_xx_xx_xx.tgz 
      It should create a directory with the source code. Below $magnus will
      refer to this directory.

   2) Run $magnus/Configure script. The script will ask for
      verification that the current directory is correct, and then ask for 
      the path to the tcl executable "wish". (You should verify the path of 
      your wish executable by typing the command, "which wish", and then 
      answer with the path that the "which wish" command gave you.) 

   3) To invoke magnus type:
         $ $magnus/front_end/magnus.

 NOTE:

 If you later change the location of $magnus directory, you need not recompile, 
 but you must run $magnus/Configure again.
