@@How this problem works

\ni In order to see if an element is a proper power, we compute
a maximal root of the element. This comes equipped with a positive
integer giving us the power of the maximal root that coincides with
the given element. If that power is greater than 1, the element is
a proper power, otherwise it is not.
