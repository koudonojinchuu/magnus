@@How this problem works

\ni We first find the primary decomposition of the given group.
Each of the generators occuring in the given word is then 
re-expressed in terms of the new generators that have been
obtained in the primary decomposition, leading to a representation
of the given word in terms of the primary decomposition, i.e.,
its primary form.
