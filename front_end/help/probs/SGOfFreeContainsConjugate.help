\ni This algorithm depends on the algorithm which determines whether a
conjugate of a given element lies in a given subgroup. One applies this
algorithm to all of the generators of the first subgroup to see if a
conjugate of each of the generators lies in the second subgroup and if
so, whether a single element conjugates all of the generators of the
first subgroup into the second.
