Any word of the subgroup can be rewritten in the form

\ni u = x_1 ... x_n = (s_0 x_1 s_1^-1) ... (s_n-1 x_n s_n^-1),

\ni where s_i are representatives for initial subwords x_1 ... x_i
and all nontrivial s_i-1 x_i s_i^-1 generate the subgroup.

\ni See also @The word representative@probs/WordRepresentativeProblem::FP@.
