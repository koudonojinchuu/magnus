@@How this problem works

\ni In order to compute the p-height of an element, we compute
its primary decomposition. If the element is of finite order
prime to p, its p-height is infinite. Otherwise, its p-height
can be read off from is primary decomposition. It is enough to
note that if a is an element of either infinite order or of p-power
order, then the p-height of a^n is the largest power of p dividing 
n, whenever a^n is not equal to 1.
