%%  <text>
%%
%%  <text> prints  the text in  an italics font  in the printed manual and is
%%  displayed  unchanged in the  on-screen  documentation.  It should be used
%%  for arguments  in description of  GAP functions and   other placeholders.
%%  The  text should not contain any special characters.  |\<| can be used to

%%  *text*
%%
%%  *text*  prints the text  in boldface font   in the printed manual and  is
%%  displayed unchanged in the on-screen  documentation.  It  should  be used

%%  documentation it  remains unchanged, except  that the pipes are stripped.
%%  It should be used to  enter lengthy examples  into the text.  If the hash

%%  the line  is set in  ordinary mode,  i.e., in  roman   font with  all the

%%  <item>: <text>
%%
%%  This formats the  paragraph  <text>, i.e.,  everything between  the colon
%%  '\:' and the next  empty  line, indented 1 cm to the right in the printed
%%  manual and is displayed  unchanged in the  on-screen documentation.  This
%%  convention should be  used to format  a list or an enumeration.    <item>
%%  should be  a single  word  or a short phrase.  It  may contain  all usual
%%  characters and the usual formatting stuff.  <text> is a  normal paragraph
%%  and may contain everything.   \:  can be used  to enter a colon character
%%  into the text.  As  an example consider the  following description.  This
%%  will print quite similar in the printed manual.
%%
%%      A group is represented by a record that must have the components
%%
