# ACE 2002 fails this test; since relators of length one are not
#   processed properly during CT deductions/definitions!
# ACE3 does the business; we illustrate the entire definition sequence,
#   with hole %'s.
# We also illustrate table printing & compacting/standardising; note that
#   Felsch mode produces a standardised table. 

Enumeration:      G (aka C_5);
