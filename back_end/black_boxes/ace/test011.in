# Email from C.C. Sims to G. Havas, re importance of stacking _all_ 
#   deductions.
# Note how all the table bar one entry (& its inverse) is full after the
#   SG phase, and how, after the 1st DD is pulled off it causes a coinc &
#   a full table.
# (The top of the dedn stack contains 6.5, ie, 6c=3, and tracing this on
#   c^3 causes the coinc 3=6.
# Folding row #6 into #3 gives a full table.)
# If subsequent dedns are missed, then an index of 5 is returned, instead 
#   of 1.
# Note: the mode ("pure C", or "Felsch") & the "asis" are important here!
# Also, note the "loop:2", to allow the final result checking phase to
#   be run!
