# F(2,7) is a good test of the pref defn _code_, since all its relators
#   are of length 3.
# It is not a good demo of the _effect_ of pref defn (in general), since 
#   the results vary erratically for various parameter values.
# We demo/test these (& no. relators in subgroup) here, making use of
#   the "ai:" feature to run through a list of values.

# The first runs demonstrates "pure C"/"Felsch" styles; these are the
#   same apart from "Com", which is not activated here.
# It also demonstrates the `default' Felsch mode, where we activate "No"
#   & "Fi" (the default values of these are not good here).
