# A non-trivial presentation of C_11, by M. Wicks.
# Note how the powers of "y" add up to 11, and those for "x" add up to
#   8 & 9 (which are co-prime); so "y" generates & "x" is trivial.
# See the paper by Havas, Holt, Keene & Rees.
# These are attempts to find `good' parameters; "hard" with knr/knh `balanced'
#   & mendel on seems to work well, and the "Sims" modes are sometimes
#   successful.
# Note that the enumerations with pmod:2 & v. large fill-factors allow lots of
#   the gaps of length one (of which there are some, but not an enormous
#   number) to be filled immediately.
#
# Note: we can actually do this with t<8000000.
# In fact, we can do this with "Gen: ;"!
# See the ~/grp/c11 directory.
