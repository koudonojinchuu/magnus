On 5/12/95, Roger Needham made some changes to the source files for
compatibility with gcc 2.6.3.
  I had to

* Globally change the identifier `bool' to `bool_t'.

* Globally change the identifier `boolean' to `boolean_t'.

* In portable.h
  - change `enum boolean {FALSE, TRUE};' to `enum boolean_t_enum {FALSE, TRUE};'
  - make the `typedef int boolean_t;'

* In subsystm.C, line 343
  - change
      cout << "No index used with identities!" << cout;
    to
      cout << "No index used with identities!" << endl;

* In subsystm.h, line 130
  - change
      { rule_by_origin(origin.extract_long(numb),p_rule); }
    to
      {
        long temp = origin.extract_long(numb);
        rule_by_origin(temp,p_rule);
      }
    so as not to pass an rvalue by reference.
