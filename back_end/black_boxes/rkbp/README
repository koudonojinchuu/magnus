The file rkbp120.tar.Z in this directory contains Version 1.20 of the
Rutgers Knuth-Bendix Package (RKBP).  To install the package, copy
rkbp120.tar.Z to an appropriate directory.  Don't forget it is a
binary file.  Then execute the following commands:

uncompress rkbp120.tar
tar xvf rkbp120.tar

The result will be to create four subdirectories.  The directory bin
contains an executable image rkbp compiled with version 2.4.5 of g++
for Sun4 architectures.  The directory examples contains sample input
data files.  The directory documentation contains a plain TeX file for
the user's manual together with dvi and postscript files.  The
directory source contains the header and C++ source files.  To compile
them using g++, issue the command

g++ -O -o rkbp *.C

Version 2.4.5 of g++ as installed at Rutgers issues a few warnings but
compiles correctly.  Put the file rkbp in a directory in your path.

In 31 years of writing group-theoretic software, this is the first
program I have distributed in any organized basis.  There are bound to
be problems.  Please send mail to sims@math.rutgers.edu to let me know
you have taken a copy.  Problem reports may be sent to the same
address.
