Homology Project
================

These programs make use of the Homology C Library included in this
distribution.

The makefile
============

You may have to edit the makefile to suit your particular system.  The makefile
is intially set up for use with full optimisation on the DEC cc compiler.
To alter this, there are sections in the makefile that clearly show what
things should be altered for other systems.  Read the comments in the
makefile for details.

Systems without a command line
==============================

The programs here are set up to use command line arguments in most cases.
This is a problem on some systems (such as the Macintosh) which do not have
a command line.  In these cases users can compile the source files to
produce executables that will prompt and take information from standard
input.

There are 2 ways this can be done.

1) The makefile provided includes a macro that will compile the programs
to not use a command line interface.  This Macro is NO_CMD_LINE.  If
your compiler system supports make files, you should edit the makefile
and remove the comment '#' from the line:

#NO_CMD_LINE = -DNO_CMD_LINE

then run make.

2) If your system does not support makefiles, then you must edit each source
file and remove the C-style comments (/*...*/) from the line:

/*#define NO_CMD_LINE */

then compile the programs according to your system.

Other things to Note:
=====================

The program 'calchom' is a csh script that will typically run under UNIX.
As such, it does not provide for non-command-line environments.

The programs 'calchom', 'chom' and 'chom_stats' use another program called
'magma'.  This program may at this point only be available under UNIX.

chom_stats may not compile on some systems that do not implement "difftime"
in the time library (header "time.h") (although this is an ANSI C standard
function).  If this is the case you may have to remove all references to
chom_stats in the makefile and run make again, or edit the source for
chom_stats.
