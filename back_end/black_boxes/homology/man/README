A NOTE ON MAN PAGES
===================

Because of a bug in the 'man' program on DECS, it is not possible to put
the man pages in any directory.  They must go in the directory that all
other man pages are placed.  If for some reason this is not possible, you
will need to use the -P option on 'man' to tell 'man' where the pages
can be found...for example:

man -P /usr/local/public/man rank

This bug may be fixed in more recent executables, so that one can make use
of the MAN_PATH environment variable.  See your OS documentation for details.
