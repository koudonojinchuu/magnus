Computational Tools for Homology of Groups
==========================================

These directories contain the Homology C library, programs that make
use of this library and man pages for these programs.

For those who are interested, a detailed function-by-function manual
for the Homology C Library is available in Word 2.0 format (PC), or
hard copy from Dr John Groves.

Please also read the README files in many of the sub directories.

lib
---
This contains the Homology C Library source, and upon making is
where the libraries are stored.

src
---
This contains two subdirectories containing the source of programs
that were created for the project.

bin
---
This is where the executables will go on making files in the src
sub-directories.  You can then move them to where ever you like.

man
---
These are the man pages, which need to be installed in the appropriate manual
area.

A NOTE ON MAN PAGES
===================

Because of a bug in the 'man' program on DECS, it is not possible to put
the man pages in any directory.  They must go in the directory that all
other man pages are placed.  If for some reason this is not possible, you
will need to use the -P option on 'man' to tell 'man' where the pages
can be found...for example:

man -P /usr/local/public/man rank

This bug may be fixed in more recent executables, so that one can make use
of the MAN_PATH environment variable.  See your OS documentation for details.
