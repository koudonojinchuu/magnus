In order to make the Homology C Library, you should copy one of the two
makefiles provided to 'makefile'.  The two makefiles are:

+ makefile.dec (specifically set up for the DECs cc compiler)

+ makefile.gen (a general makefile using gcc, that in most cases will not
  require alterations)

Once you have your 'makefile' you should run 'make'.  The library(s)
produced reside in this directory.
