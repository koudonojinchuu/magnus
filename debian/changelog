magnus (20060324-5.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Fix FTBFS with gcc 4.3 (closes: #455399):
    - #include <iostream> instead of <iostream.h>, etc.
    - #include assorted missing stdlib headers
    - using std::foo
    - don't re-#define RAND_MAX if the platform defines it correctly (which
      we do)

magnus (20060324-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated for new debian menu layout.  Menu entry has moved from Apps/Math
    to Applications/Science/Mathematics.
  * No longer ignores errors in the debian/rules clean target, unless those
    errors are due to missing Makefiles.
  * The debian/rules clean target now removes several TeX-related output
    files from doc/manual/.  Some of these files are shipped in the sources
    and remade at build time, which caused problems when building magnus
    twice in a row (closes: #424564).
  * Likewise, debian/rules clean now removes some other miscellaneous files
    that are made at build time but were not being cleaned away.
  * Added tcl8.4 | tclsh to the dependency list, since magnus includes a tclsh
    script.  This was already brought in indirectly through the tk dependency,
    but this extra clarification can't hurt.

magnus (20060324-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sigh.  Use SIG_ERR instead of -1 to fix build error on 64-bit machines
    (closes: #367362).

 -- Ben Burton <bab@debian.org>  Tue, 16 May 2006 00:08:05 +1000

magnus (20060324-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Patched to build under g++-4.1 (closes: #355996).
  * Now builds and installs the Magnus reference manual.

magnus (20050624-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Builds using g++-4.x and tk8.4 instead of g++-3.x and tk8.3.
  * Patched for g++-4.x compatibility.
  * Patched to use const_cast where C-style casts were causing undefined
    behaviour (and in particular, mangled session messages).
  * Changed to new upstream URL.
  * Bumped standards-version to 3.6.2.1 (no changes required).

  * Initialise data member index to 0 in FEData::KeyRep constructor to
    fix FTBFS (closes: #242401).
  * Bumped standards-version to 3.6.1.

 -- Ben Burton <bab@debian.org>  Wed, 27 Aug 2003 20:04:25 +1000

magnus (4.1.1-beta-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed #include <strstream.h> to #include <strstream> where it
    occurs (closes: #196422).  At this point I'd rather just change the
    legacy #includes than risk breaking the code with an upgrade to
    stringstreams.
  * Replaced ### with # in CONDITION.h to avoid preprocessor errors.
  * Other minor cleanups for gcc3.3 compatibility.
